# C++ Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by theÂ recurrence relation.

F0 = 0, F1 = 1,

and

Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

for n > 1.

Under some older definitions, the value F0 = 0 is omitted, so that the sequence starts with F1 = F2 = 1, and the recurrence Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) is valid for n > 2.

The first 10 Fibonacci numbers Fn are:

| F0  | F1  | F2  | F3  | F4  | F5  | F6  | F7  | F8  | F9  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 5   | 8   | 13  | 21  | 34  |
