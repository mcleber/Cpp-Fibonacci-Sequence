# C++ Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by theÂ recurrence relation.

Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

The first 10 Fibonacci numbers Fn are:

| n = | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fn = | 0   | 1   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 5   | 8   | 13  | 21  | 34  |

### Update 2023/08/06 - v.1.1:
- Added sequence calculation using recursive function;
- Added the header file cmath;
- Fixed system("CLS") to system("clear || cls");
- Source code organized by scope.

### Run on Linux
``g++ FibonacciSequence.cpp -o FibonacciSequence``

``./FibonacciSequence``
