# C++ Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by theÂ recurrence relation.

Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

The first 10 Fibonacci numbers Fn are:

| n = | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fn = | 0   | 1   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 5   | 8   | 13  | 21  | 34  |
